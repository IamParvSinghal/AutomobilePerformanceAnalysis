    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Technical Skills, Education, and Experience:** I am well-versed in Python and have good experience with C, C++, Java, and R. My programming background spans across numerical computing, algorithm development, and software optimization. For mathematics, I have studied Calculus 1 to 3, Discrete Mathematics, and Linear Algebra. I have a strong knowledge of Graph Theory and Network Flow, which is useful for understanding combinatorial structures and optimization problems. Additionally, I have basic experience with Geometric and Advanced Algebra. I am extremely comfortable with Linear Algebra, which is fundamental to working with Riemann matrices and symplectic transformations in my proposed project. Some of my Other relevant mathematical knowledge includes, Abstract Algebra (useful for understanding the algebraic structures behind modular transformations), Complex Analysis (which plays a role in the properties of Riemann surfaces and theta functions), Differential Geometry (since Riemann surfaces have connections to geometric structures). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Personal Motivation:** As someone who is actively engaged in research, I would absolutely LOVE to contribute to SageMath because of its potential to simplify high-level computations in algorithmic applications. While I began exploring SageMath only two weeks ago when researching organizations for GSoC, I quickly realized its immense value in computational mathematics. Given my strong mathematical and programming background, I am very confident that I am well-qualified candidate for this project. My experience with algorithmic optimizations and numerical methods quite directly aligns with the objectives of the project. While I am still learning about advanced concepts in advanced algebra and other mathematical topics, my passion is for Math (and just logical stuff in general) is unmatched. I also read Dr Linden Disney-Hogg's 2023 paper \"Towards a classification of charge-3 monopoles with symmetry.\" While a lot of it went right over my head, I learned something super interesting: even in seemingly chaotic physical systems, underlying patterns and symmetries govern their behavior. I find the ability to simply complex data into simple and understandable statistics super relieving and calming. Dr. Linden's work has been truly inpiring and I would love to work with him.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Computing Environment:** I am very experienced with using WSL for development as I regularly use it for my research.\n",
    "- **Open-Source Experience and Pet Projects:** While I haven't previously contributed to open-source projects, I have developed numerous pet projects that demonstrate my ability to work on complex computational problems. Some of these include an automobile performance analysis, several API-based applications and an image recognition project using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and feature extraction. These projects showcase my strong foundation in machine learning, particularly in areas such as neural network architectures (including CNNs and RNNs), optimization techniques, as well as feature engineering, data preprocessing, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning. My experience also extends to computer vision using OpenCV and deep learning with PyTorch.\n",
    "- **SageMath Experience:** Like I mentioned earlier I began using SageMath about two weeks ago when exploring organizations for GSoC. Using SageMath revealed its huge potential for simplifying high-level computations in algorithmic applications, which is one of the primary reasons I am interested in contributing."

    "## 1. Proposal Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Riemann matrices, which encode the period integrals of holomorphic differentials on a Riemann surface, play a central role in the theory of theta functions. In many applications, from string theory in mathematical physics to number theory and algebraic geometry, the ability to compute these theta functions efficiently is crucial. The Poincaré reduction transforms a Riemann matrix into a canonical “normal form” that simplifies the theta function into a factorized product. This reduction not only aids in computational efficiency but also deepens the understanding of the underlying geometry of Riemann surfaces.\n",
